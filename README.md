# Swell-History
Swell History is a tool to help an interested surfer analyze historical ocean swell data

## Background
I am working on this project as a fun way to learn specific skills including SQL databases, Public API's, and Flask/HTML. I have been surfing for about 15 years and would love a tool that could compare the current season/swell forecasts to historical data.

## Functionality Goals
This section will outline the functionalities I plan to build into the tool

### Main Forecast Page
This page will allow user to select from a wide list of surf spots with the ability to compare data of current conditions with historical data for that same time period of the year. The page will include surf reports to include: 
- Swell Heights and Periods
- Tides
- Air Temp
- Water Temp
- First light/Sunrise & Sunset/Last Light
